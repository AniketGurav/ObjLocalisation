# ObjLocalisation

The aim of this project is to make an object localisation system for a Baxter robot. Pascal VOC dataset is used for training. The goal is to learn a policy to localise an object in a scene with a sequence of actions including zooming in, zooming out, left, right, up, and down. Deep reinforcement learning is used to learn the policy.

## TO do list:

1. Filter non-object examples like person calss
2. Probably I need to use other versions of VOC ()
3. Check the original paper you might need to use a pre-trained
